## Description


###  Overview
This application example shows how to export Simulink virtual sensor model and run it on a Industrial Edge Device with LiveTwin edge application. The model can read data from PLC and send the current status back to the PLC. 

### General task
The main goal of this automation task is to create Simulink model that simulates shock sensor, export it in the required format and run it on the Industrial Edge Device using LiveTwin. The edge device can read data from PLC simulating vibrations via integrated S7 Connector using S7 communication protocol. Based on logic in the SIMATIC Flow Creator, the model can evaluate whether the vibrations have occurred and send the current shock status back to PLC. The data flow can be visualized directly in LiveTwin.
